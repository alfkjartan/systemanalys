The Anaconda distribution contains by default many of the most common python modules for scientific computing. However, it does not come with [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). To install this, open the Anaconda prompt (Start -> All Programs -> Anaconda -> Anaconda prompt) and write\n",

    "You can manage your Anaconda installation and launch programs from the Anaconda Navigator (Start -> All Programs -> Anaconda -> Anaconda Navigator). The anaconda distribution does come with Jupyter, which is a program that lets you work with notebooks (code and documentation interwoven) in your favourite browser. Wonderful to work with! \n",

    "### Jupyter \n",
    "Writing and running the simulation will be done using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) notebooks. This getting-started-guide is written as a Jupyter notebook. You may be reading this and running the command in jupyter. Or if you are reading the pdf-version you are encouraged to jump over to the Jupyter version right away. You can launch Jupyter notebook from the Anaconda Navigator. This will open a new tab in your default web browser. It shows the current working directory from which you can create folders, files or notebooks. Navigate to the folder containing this notebook (`systemanalys/doc`) and open the notebook Introduction to Python. "

The first call to `next()` causes the code in the definition of the generator to be executed from the top to the first occurance of `yield`. The statment `yield` is similar to a return statement in a regular function. However, in the next call to `next()`, the execution starts at the first line after the `yield` statement that caused the previous return to the caller. The execution goes on to the next occurance of `yield`. The local variables in the definition of the generator retains there values between calls to `next()`. \n",

Each rabbit has exactly one offspring in each time step, except for an initial newborn-period of one time step.
